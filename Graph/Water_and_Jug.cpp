// Water and Jug
//  BÃ©zout's identity which states that for any integers a and b, the equation ax + by = d has a solution if and only if d is a multiple of gcd(a, b). In the context of water jugs:
// a and b are the jug capacities x and y.
// d is the target amount of water.
// Thus, the target must be a multiple of gcd(x, y) for it to be possible to measure exactly target liters.
